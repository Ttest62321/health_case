# MyHealthCase
MyHealthCase is an application that facilitates managing personal health data. The application is built using React UI and consuming a versioned Rails API. The application is simply designed with the less technically comfortable in mind as the target user.

It was built from the ground up over a 12 day period as a personal a capstone project at the Turing School of Software & Design. This is my first time using React.

### Prerequisites
